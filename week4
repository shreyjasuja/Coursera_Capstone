Problem:

Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred.

Based on these reports, Boston City police wants to determine areas where they can establish their new stations.
They want to cover the areas which have maximum crime rates  in order to reduce the crime in the city and so that the police  becomes more accessible to approach..








Aproach:

We need the following info-

What types of crimes are most common?
Where are different types of crimes most likely to occur?
Does the frequency of crimes change over the day? Week? Year?

I will be using Boston Crime Rate data set  to solve this problem https://www.kaggle.com/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston#crime.csv
Along with this foursquare api will also be used to determine the most dense locations of crime and visualize it .
Folium Maps along with foursquare api will be clubbed to visualize the areas so that the police can also understand it easily.
